# Contributing to Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0! This project is in its very early conceptual stages, aiming to define the architecture for a fully autonomous AI DevOps platform. The current repository contains the foundational design and a proof-of-concept demonstration.

## Current Stage: Design and Conceptualization / Proof-of-Concept

At this moment, contributions are primarily focused on refining the design, architecture, and specification documents, or extending the proof-of-concept. As the project evolves, opportunities for more in-depth code contributions to the core AI agents and backend systems will become available.

## How to Contribute (Conceptual for Future Development)

Once the project moves beyond the initial design and PoC phase into full-scale development, the following contribution workflow will be adopted:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the main Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 repository.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
    `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix`.
3.  **Make Changes:** Implement your changes, adhering to the coding standards and design principles outlined in the documentation (once established).
4.  **Write Tests:** Ensure that your changes are well-tested. Add unit tests and integration tests as appropriate.
5.  **Update Documentation:** If your changes affect the API, architecture, or user-facing features, update the relevant documentation.
6.  **Commit Your Changes:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
7.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository.
8.  **Submit a Pull Request:** Open a pull request to the `main` branch of the original repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and why they are needed.

## Code of Conduct (Placeholder)

We aim to foster an open and welcoming environment. All contributors are expected to adhere to a Code of Conduct (to be defined, but generally based on principles of respect, collaboration, and inclusivity).

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug in the proof-of-concept or have a suggestion for the design:
1.  Check the existing issues to see if it has already been reported.
2.  If not, create a new issue, providing as much detail as possible:
    *   Steps to reproduce (for bugs).
    *   Expected behavior.
    *   Actual behavior.
    *   Screenshots (if applicable).
    *   Your suggestions for improvement.

## Questions?

(Details on how to ask questions will be provided once communication channels like a Discord server or mailing list are set up). For now, you can raise an issue on GitHub.

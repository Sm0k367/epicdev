# Epic Landing Page - AI Generated Project

This landing page was generated completely autonomously by **Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0** using intelligent AI agents. It serves as a demonstration of the code generation capabilities of the platform.

## ü§ñ Generated by AI Agents (Conceptual Simulation)

- **PromptCompilerAgent**: Analyzed a user prompt (e.g., "Build a static HTML landing page with a contact form and responsive design").
- **CodeGenAgent**: Generated all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for this page.
- **UXAgent**: Ensured responsive design and accessibility best practices were considered.
- **DocsAgent**: Generated this README file.

## üìã Project Overview

This is a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript landing page featuring:
- A modern, professional design.
- Responsive layout for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Key sections: Header, Hero, Features, About, Contact Form, Footer.
- Interactive elements and smooth scrolling.
- A functional (simulated submission) contact form with client-side validation.

## üõ† Tech Stack (Generated)

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with custom properties, Flexbox, and Grid for layout.
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6 (via CDN).
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA considerations (conceptual).
- **Performance**: Basic optimizations (conceptual, full build would include minification, image optimization etc.).

## üöÄ How to View

1.  **Directly in Browser:**
    *   Clone the parent repository (`epicdev`).
    *   Navigate to the `projects/sample_landing_page/src/` directory.
    *   Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  **Via the PoC Server (if running):**
    *   If you are running the `server.js` from the root of the `epicdev` project, you can access this page at:
        `http://localhost:8080/sample-project` or `http://localhost:8080/projects/sample_landing_page/src/index.html`
        (The port might vary if you changed it in `server.js` or if 8080 is occupied).

## üìÅ Project Structure

Located within `projects/sample_landing_page/`:
src/ ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html # Main HTML structure ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css # All CSS styles ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js # JavaScript for interactivity and form handling .gitignore # Git ignore rules for this sub-project README.md # This file


## ‚ú® Features Implemented

- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Smooth Scrolling Navigation:** Clicking nav links scrolls smoothly to sections.
- **Active Navigation Highlighting:** Current section's link is highlighted.
- **Hero Section:** With a call-to-action.
- **Features Section:** Showcasing product/service features.
- **About Section:** Information about the product/company.
- **Contact Form:**
    - Client-side validation for name and email.
    - Simulated form submission (logs to console, displays success/error message).
- **Footer:** With links and social media icons.
- **Scroll Animations:** Subtle fade-in animations for elements as they enter the viewport.
- **Theme Detection:** Basic detection for user's preferred dark mode (adds a class to `body`).

## üîß Potential Customization (Manual)

- **Content:** Modify text and images directly in `index.html`.
- **Styling:** Adjust colors, fonts, and layout in `styles.css`.
- **JavaScript:** Enhance interactivity or form handling in `script.js`.
- **Contact Form Backend:** To make the contact form send real emails, you would need to integrate it with a backend service (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms, or a custom backend API). The `script.js` currently simulates submission.

## üìÑ License

This generated sample project is typically covered by the overall license of the Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 platform (e.g., MIT License, if specified at the root).

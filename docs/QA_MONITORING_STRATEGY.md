# Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 - QA & Monitoring Strategy (Conceptual)

This document outlines the conceptual Quality Assurance (QA) and Monitoring strategy for the Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 platform and the applications it generates.

## I. Quality Assurance (QA) Strategy

### A. For the Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 Platform Itself:

1.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   Each AI agent microservice and core platform component will have comprehensive unit tests.
    *   Focus on testing individual functions, modules, and classes.
    *   Tools: Jest/Mocha (Node.js), PyTest (Python), Go testing package.
2.  **Integration Testing:**
    *   Test interactions between AI agents via the Shared Memory System (e.g., RabbitMQ).
    *   Test API Gateway integrations with backend services.
    *   Test interactions with external platform APIs (GitHub, Vercel, etc.) using mocks or dedicated test accounts.
3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    *   Simulate user workflows: from submitting a prompt to verifying a deployed application.
    *   Automate UI testing for the dashboard using tools like Playwright or Cypress.
    *   Test CLI commands and their expected outcomes.
4.  **Performance Testing:**
    *   Load testing for the API Gateway and core services.
    *   Stress testing to identify bottlenecks.
    *   Measure response times and resource utilization.
5.  **Security Testing:**
    *   Regular penetration testing.
    *   Vulnerability scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning).
    *   Security audits of authentication and authorization mechanisms.
6.  **Usability Testing:**
    *   Gather user feedback on the dashboard and overall platform experience.
7.  **CI/CD Integration:**
    *   Automate all tests to run in CI/CD pipelines upon code changes.
    *   Builds fail if tests do not pass.
    *   Code coverage metrics tracked (e.g., aiming for >80%).

### B. For Applications Generated by Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0:

The `TestAgent` is responsible for generating tests for the applications created by the platform.

1.  **Generated Unit Tests:**
    *   `TestAgent` analyzes code generated by `CodeGenAgent` and creates relevant unit tests.
    *   Covers critical business logic, components, and utility functions.
    *   Uses appropriate testing frameworks for the generated language/stack (e.g., Jest for React, PyTest for Flask).
2.  **Generated Integration Tests (Basic):**
    *   `TestAgent` may generate basic integration tests, e.g., testing API endpoint responses or interactions between key backend modules.
3.  **Linting & Static Analysis:**
    *   `TestAgent` (or `CodeGenAgent` itself) ensures generated code adheres to linters (ESLint, Prettier, Flake8) and static analysis tools.
4.  **Code Coverage Reports:**
    *   Generated tests should aim for reasonable code coverage for the AI-generated application code.
5.  **Smoke Tests Post-Deployment:**
    *   `DeployAgent` or `MonitorAgent` could run basic smoke tests on deployed applications (e.g., checking if the main page loads with HTTP 200).

## II. Monitoring Strategy

### A. Monitoring the Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 Platform:

1.  **Infrastructure Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage of servers/containers running platform components.
    *   Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Monitoring.
2.  **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):**
    *   Track performance of AI agent microservices and API Gateway (response times, error rates, throughput).
    *   Tools: Sentry, Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace.
3.  **Log Management:**
    *   Centralized logging for all platform components.
    *   Structured logging (e.g., JSON format).
    *   Tools: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Grafana Loki, Splunk.
4.  **Shared Memory System Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor queue lengths, message rates, consumer health for RabbitMQ/Redis/Kafka.
5.  **Database Monitoring:**
    *   Monitor query performance, connections, replication status for the Project & State Management DB.
6.  **Security Monitoring:**
    *   SIEM for security event correlation.
    *   Intrusion detection and prevention.
    *   Monitor for suspicious activity based on audit logs.
7.  **Alerting:**
    *   Set up alerts for critical issues (e.g., high error rates, service downtime, security breaches, resource exhaustion).
    *   Integration with PagerDuty, Slack, email.

### B. Monitoring Applications Generated by Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 (Conceptual - via `MonitorAgent`):

1.  **Uptime Monitoring:**
    *   `MonitorAgent` integrates with external uptime checking services (e.g., UptimeRobot, Pingdom) or performs its own checks for deployed applications.
2.  **Error Tracking Integration:**
    *   `CodeGenAgent` can optionally include error tracking SDKs (e.g., Sentry) in the generated application code.
    *   `MonitorAgent` can then access or be notified by these services.
3.  **Basic Performance Metrics:**
    *   `MonitorAgent` could collect basic metrics like page load times (e.g., using Lighthouse API) or API response times for generated apps.
4.  **Log Collection (Limited):**
    *   If deployment platforms provide log streaming (e.g., Vercel, Netlify functions), `MonitorAgent` could ingest these logs.
5.  **User Analytics (Optional Integration):**
    *   `CodeGenAgent` could include stubs for analytics tools (PostHog, Plausible, Google Analytics) if requested by the user. `MonitorAgent` could potentially provide a unified view if APIs are available.

This strategy aims to ensure the reliability, performance, and quality of both the Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 platform itself and the applications it autonomously generates. The current PoC does not implement these extensive QA and monitoring systems.

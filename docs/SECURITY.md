# Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 - Security Design (Conceptual)

This document outlines the conceptual security architecture and considerations for the Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 platform.

## 1. Core Security Principles

-   **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security controls.
-   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users and services operate with the minimum necessary permissions.
-   **Secure by Default:** Security features are enabled by default.
-   **Zero Trust:** Never trust, always verify. Authenticate and authorize every request.
-   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
-   **Regular Audits & Monitoring:** Continuously monitor for threats and audit system activity.
-   **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC):** Integrate security into all phases of development.

## 2. Authentication (Conceptual)

-   **User Authentication:**
    -   **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect:** Preferred method, integrating with providers like GitHub, Google. This allows users to leverage existing trusted identities.
    -   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforced for all user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
-   **Service-to-Service Authentication:**
    -   Internal AI agents (microservices) would authenticate with each other using methods like mutual TLS (mTLS) or short-lived JWTs/tokens issued by an internal identity provider.
-   **API Authentication:**
    -   All API endpoints (REST/GraphQL) protected.
    -   Clients (Web Dashboard, CLI, external integrations) use JWT Bearer tokens obtained via the OAuth flow.

## 3. Authorization (Conceptual)

-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    -   Define roles (e.g., `Admin`, `Developer`, `Viewer`).
    -   Assign permissions to roles (e.g., `project:create`, `project:read`, `deployment:trigger`, `user:manage`).
    -   Users are assigned roles, inheriting permissions.
-   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**
    -   Could be used for more granular control, e.g., allowing a user to only access projects they own or are collaborated on.
-   **Policy Enforcement Points:** Authorization checks performed at the API Gateway and within individual services.

## 4. Secret Management (Conceptual)

-   **Secure Vault:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
-   **Types of Secrets:**
    -   API keys for third-party services (GitHub, Vercel, Cloudflare, etc.).
    -   Database credentials.
    -   Encryption keys.
    -   Internal service credentials.
-   **Access Control:** Strict access controls on who/what can retrieve secrets.
-   **Rotation:** Automated rotation policies for secrets where possible.
-   **Dynamic Secrets:** Generate short-lived credentials for services where supported.
-   **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Secrets must never be hardcoded in source code or configuration files. They should be injected at runtime from the vault or secure environment variables.

## 5. Data Security (Conceptual)

-   **Encryption at Rest:**
    -   Databases (Project & State Management DB) should use transparent data encryption (TDE) or full-disk encryption.
    -   Sensitive fields within the database (e.g., user-provided API keys before they are moved to a vault) should be encrypted at the application level.
    -   Object storage (for build artifacts, logs) should have server-side encryption enabled.
-   **Encryption in Transit:**
    -   **TLS 1.2+ (preferably 1.3):** Enforced for all external communication (User Interfaces to API Gateway, API Gateway to external platforms).
    -   **mTLS:** For internal service-to-service communication within the cluster.
-   **Data Minimization:** Collect and store only the data essential for the platform's operation.
-   **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
    -   Rigorously validate all user inputs (prompts, configuration values) to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi, command injection).
    -   Sanitize outputs displayed in the UI.

## 6. Infrastructure Security (Conceptual)

-   **Network Security:**
    -   Firewalls, security groups, network segmentation to isolate services.
    -   Private networks for internal communication.
    -   DDoS protection for public-facing endpoints.
-   **Container Security:**
    -   Scan container images for vulnerabilities.
    -   Use minimal base images.
    -   Run containers with least privilege (non-root users).
    -   Implement runtime security monitoring for containers.
-   **Secure Configurations:** Harden OS, services, and applications.

## 7. Code Security & SSDLC (Conceptual)

-   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Integrate into CI/CD pipelines to scan code for vulnerabilities.
-   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Periodically test running applications.
-   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities (e.g., `npm audit`, Snyk).
-   **Code Reviews:** Security-focused code reviews.
-   **Threat Modeling:** Identify potential threats and design mitigations.

## 8. Logging and Monitoring (Conceptual)

-   **Comprehensive Audit Logs:** Log all significant events, especially security-related ones (logins, permission changes, resource access, API calls).
-   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Aggregate and analyze logs to detect suspicious activity.
-   **Alerting:** Real-time alerts for security incidents or anomalies.
-   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).**

## 9. Incident Response Plan (Conceptual)

-   A documented plan for handling security incidents, including:
    -   Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned.

The security of Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 is paramount. This conceptual design outlines key areas to address for a robust and secure platform. The current PoC server (`server.js`) is for demonstration only and does not implement these advanced security measures.

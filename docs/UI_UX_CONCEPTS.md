# Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0 - UI/UX Design Concepts (Dashboard)

This document outlines the key UI/UX concepts for the web-based dashboard of Epic Tech AI Dev 2.0. The goal is to create an intuitive, powerful, and enjoyable interface for users to interact with the autonomous AI DevOps platform. A basic HTML/CSS/JS PoC of some of these concepts is in the `dashboard/` directory.

## Core Design Principles:

-   **Simplicity & Intuitiveness:** Users should be able to achieve complex tasks with minimal cognitive load.
-   **Clarity & Transparency:** Provide clear feedback on processes, status, and AI agent actions.
-   **Efficiency:** Streamline common workflows, making it fast to go from prompt to deployed application.
-   **Empowerment:** Give users control and visibility, while abstracting away unnecessary complexity.
-   **Modern & Professional Aesthetic:** Clean, visually appealing, and trustworthy design.
-   **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA):** Ensure the platform is usable by people with diverse abilities.
-   **Responsiveness:** Seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Key Dashboard Sections & Features:

1.  **Main Prompt Input Interface:**
    *   **Large Text Area:** Prominent, inviting area for users to type their natural language prompts.
    *   **Prompt Assistant (Conceptual):**
        *   Real-time suggestions or clarifications as the user types.
        *   Examples of effective prompts.
        *   Ability to select common project types or tech stacks quickly.
    *   **"Create Project" Button:** Clear call to action.

2.  **Project Overview / Dashboard Home:**
    *   **Project Cards:** Visual representation of each project.
        *   Display: Project name, status (e.g., planning, coding, deploying, live, failed), last updated, key technologies.
        *   Quick actions: View details, redeploy, view logs, delete.
        *   Visual progress indicators for ongoing tasks.
    *   **Filtering & Sorting:** Allow users to filter projects by status, tags, date, etc.
    *   **Search Functionality:** Quickly find projects.

3.  **Project Detail View:**
    *   **Comprehensive Overview:** All information about a specific project.
    *   **Visual Flowchart of Build/Deploy Process:**
        *   Graphically represent the stages (prompt compilation, code generation, infra setup, testing, deployment).
        *   Show which AI agent is responsible for each stage.
        *   Indicate current stage and progress.
    *   **Real-time Logs:**
        *   Streaming logs from all relevant AI agents and deployment processes.
        *   Filterable by agent, log level (info, warn, error).
        *   Searchable logs.
    *   **Deployment Status & Live URLs:**
        *   List of deployment targets (e.g., Vercel, GitHub Pages).
        *   Status for each target (success, failed, in-progress).
        *   Direct links to live applications and source code repositories.
    *   **Generated Assets Browser (Conceptual):** Allow users to browse the file structure of the generated code.
    *   **Prompt History & Version Control UI:**
        *   View the original prompt and any subsequent modifications or clarifications.
        *   Ability to "rollback" to a previous version or re-run a modified prompt (conceptual, complex).
    *   **Analytics & Monitoring Data (Conceptual):** Basic performance metrics, error rates for deployed apps.
    *   **Settings/Configuration:** Project-specific settings, e.g., environment variables (managed securely), deployment targets.

4.  **User Account & Settings:**
    *   Profile management.
    *   API key management for CLI/external API access.
    *   Integration settings (e.g., connecting GitHub, Vercel accounts via OAuth).
    *   Notification preferences.

5.  **Global Elements:**
    *   **Navigation:** Clear and consistent main navigation (e.g., Projects, Settings, Docs).
    *   **Theme Switching:** Light and dark mode options.
    *   **Feedback Submission:** Easy way for users to provide feedback on the platform or specific project outcomes.
    *   **Notifications:** Real-time updates on important events (e.g., deployment success/failure).

## UX Considerations:

-   **Onboarding:** Simple and guided onboarding for new users.
-   **Error Handling:** Clear, user-friendly error messages with actionable suggestions.
-   **Loading States:** Visual feedback during loading or processing times (skeletons, spinners).
-   **Performance:** Fast load times and responsive interactions.
-   **Consistency:** Consistent design language and interaction patterns throughout the application.

## Technology Stack (Conceptual for Full Build):

-   **Frontend Framework:** React, Vue, or Svelte (PoC uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JS).
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, or a custom design system (PoC uses plain CSS).
-   **State Management:** Redux, Zustand, Vuex, or similar.
-   **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for live logs and status updates.
-   **Charting/Visualization:** Libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or React Flow for process visualization.

The `dashboard/` directory in this project contains a very basic HTML/CSS/JS mock-up to illustrate some of these visual concepts, particularly the prompt input and project card display.
